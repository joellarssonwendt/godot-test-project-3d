# Godot 3D Platformer Test

This is a test project where I am learning to use the **Godot Engine**, **GDScript**, and related tools to create a **3D game**. The goal is to transform the result of **[GDQuest](https://www.gdquest.com/)**'s tutorial on character movement in 3D and make it my own, with my own ideas and implementations to compliment and enhance what **[GDQuest](https://www.gdquest.com/)** has provided.

## Credits
